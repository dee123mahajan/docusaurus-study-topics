# Class and Functional Components
In React, components are the building blocks of a user interface. There are two primary types of components in React: class components and functional components.

## Class Components
Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component.
They have a state and lifecycle methods.
State management and side effects are typically handled within these components.
Class components are ideal for complex components that require state management, lifecycle methods, or component-wide logic.

```bash 
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  incrementCount = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.incrementCount}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```
## Functional Components

Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props and return React elements.
They are stateless and don't have lifecycle methods.
With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components can manage state and side effects using hooks like useState, useEffect, etc.
Functional components are preferred for simpler components or when using React Hooks for state management and side effects.

```bash
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCount}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;

```
Both class and functional components have their use cases, but with the introduction of React Hooks, functional components have become more powerful and are often preferred due to their simplicity and readability. However, class components are still relevant, especially in legacy codebases or when you need to integrate with third-party libraries that expect class components.
