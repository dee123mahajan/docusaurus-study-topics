#  Data types


In JavaScript, primitive data types are simple data types that represent single values, while non-primitive data types are more complex and can hold multiple values or other data types. Here's a simplified explanation:

## Primitive Data Types:

1. Basic building blocks of JavaScript.
2. They store single values directly.
3. Examples: numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined.

## Non-primitive Data Types:

1. Made up of multiple primitive or non-primitive data types.
2. They are more complex and can store collections of data.
3. Examples: arrays, objects.

## Difference
1. Primitive data types are like individual LEGO blocks, while non-primitive data types are like LEGO sets made up of multiple blocks.
2. Primitive data types are simple and directly store values, while non-primitive data types can store more complex data structures.

```bash
// Primitive data types
let age = 25; // Number
let name = "John"; // String
let isStudent = true; // Boolean
let x = null; // Null
let y = undefined; // Undefined

// Non-primitive data types
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // Array
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }; // Object

```
